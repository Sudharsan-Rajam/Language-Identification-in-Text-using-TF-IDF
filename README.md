# Language-Identification-in-Text-using-TF-IDF

Language Identification can be defined as the problem of determining which natural language given content is in. In this project, two different classification methods, Logistic Regression and Random Forest are explored, to determine what language a given text input is in. The dataset that will be used consists of historical Twitter Tweets across 7 different languages. Those languages are Chinese, English, French, Spanish, German, Hindi, and Japanese. For each language, a total of 4,000 sample Tweets were collected. This resulted in a total dataset of 28,000 records. Of those 28,000 records, 70% of those went into our training dataset, and the other 30% into the testing dataset. Using the Python programming language and supporting statistical libraries, TF-IDF was used to extract the feature vectors before being passed into both a Logistic Regression Classifier and a Random Forest Classifier.
